# ForkSure - Simple Asset List for Designer

**App**: AI baking assistant (users take photos of baked goods, get recipes)  
**Platform**: Android  
**Current Issue**: Users say visuals are "not good" - need professional design  

## What We Need (Designer Must Provide):

### 1. App Icon / Launcher Icon ✅ **PRIORITY 1**
- **What**: The icon users see on their home screen
- **Current problem**: Looks unprofessional, doesn't stand out
- **Required formats**: 
  - 512x512px PNG (for Google Play Store)
  - Adaptive icon version (foreground + background layers)
  - Multiple sizes: 48px, 72px, 96px, 144px, 192px

### 2. Splash Screen ✅ **PRIORITY 1** 
- **What**: First screen users see when opening the app
- **Current problem**: Boring, flat design users don't like
- **Required formats**:
  - Light theme version (background + logo)
  - Dark theme version (background + logo) 
  - Vector format (SVG) preferred

### 3. App Logo/Brand Mark ✅ **PRIORITY 2**
- **What**: ForkSure logo for use throughout the app
- **Current problem**: No distinctive brand identity
- **Required formats**:
  - Full logo with text (horizontal)
  - Logo icon only (square)
  - Light version (for dark backgrounds)
  - Dark version (for light backgrounds)
  - Vector format (SVG) + PNG exports

### 4. Google Play Store Graphics ✅ **PRIORITY 2**
- **What**: Images for the app store listing
- **Current problem**: No professional store presence
- **Required formats**:
  - Feature graphic: 1024x500px
  - Screenshots: Make current app screenshots look better (add frames, backgrounds, text overlays)
  - Promo images for marketing

## Design Direction:
- **Feel**: Professional AI technology + warm home baking
- **Users**: Home bakers (25-45 years old) who like trying new recipes
- **Competitors**: Should feel like Google Lens + Tasty app combined
- **Colors**: Warm food colors + modern tech colors (your choice)

## Technical Notes:
- **Android app** - needs to work on all Android phones
- **Files should be optimized** for mobile (not huge file sizes)
- **Need both light and dark versions** of everything
- **Vector formats preferred** (SVG) so they scale well

## Timeline:
- **Week 1**: App icon + splash screen (most important)
- **Week 2**: Logo + store graphics
- **Week 3**: Final polish + any revisions
