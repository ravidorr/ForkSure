# ForkSure Accessibility Guide

## Overview

ForkSure has been designed with comprehensive accessibility features to ensure an inclusive experience for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers, voice control, and switch navigation.

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### 1. Screen Reader Support (TalkBack)

#### Semantic Structure
- **Proper heading hierarchy**: Main title uses heading level 1, section titles use heading level 2
- **Meaningful content descriptions**: All interactive elements have descriptive labels
- **Live regions**: Dynamic content updates are announced to screen readers
- **Role assignments**: Buttons, images, text inputs are properly identified

#### Content Descriptions
- **Images**: All images have descriptive content descriptions
- **Buttons**: Clear descriptions of button actions and current state
- **Text fields**: Input purpose and current content are announced
- **Status updates**: Loading states, errors, and success messages are announced

### 2. Touch Accessibility

#### Touch Target Sizes
- **Minimum 48dp**: All interactive elements meet WCAG minimum touch target size
- **Recommended 56dp**: Primary actions use larger touch targets for easier interaction
- **Proper spacing**: Adequate spacing between interactive elements to prevent accidental activation

#### Haptic Feedback
- **Click feedback**: Tactile confirmation for button presses
- **Success feedback**: Distinct vibration pattern for successful actions
- **Error feedback**: Different vibration pattern for errors
- **Long press feedback**: Confirmation for long press actions

### 3. Navigation Accessibility

#### Focus Management
- **Logical focus order**: Tab navigation follows visual layout
- **Focus indicators**: Clear visual indication of focused elements
- **Focus trapping**: Modal dialogs properly trap focus

#### Custom Actions
- **Image selection**: Custom accessibility actions for selecting images
- **Quick actions**: Shortcuts for common tasks via accessibility services

### 4. Visual Accessibility

#### Color and Contrast
- **Material Design 3**: Uses system color schemes with proper contrast ratios
- **No color-only information**: Important information is not conveyed through color alone
- **High contrast support**: Respects system high contrast settings

#### Text and Typography
- **Scalable text**: Supports system font size settings
- **Minimum text size**: Ensures readability at default sizes
- **Clear typography**: Uses Material Design typography scales

### 5. Motor Accessibility

#### Alternative Input Methods
- **Voice control**: All actions can be performed via voice commands
- **Switch navigation**: Support for external switch devices
- **Reduced motion**: Respects system animation preferences

#### Error Prevention
- **Clear instructions**: Helpful guidance for complex interactions
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Important actions require confirmation
- **Undo functionality**: Ability to reverse actions where appropriate

## Accessibility Testing

### Automated Testing
The app includes `AccessibilityTestHelper` for automated validation:
- Touch target size validation
- Content description validation
- Accessibility service detection
- Comprehensive accessibility reporting

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Tab order is logical
- [ ] No keyboard traps exist

#### Visual Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Text is readable at 200% zoom
- [ ] High contrast mode works properly
- [ ] Color blind users can use all features
- [ ] Animations respect reduced motion settings

## Accessibility Features by Screen

### Main Screen
- **App title**: Semantic heading with descriptive content
- **Camera section**: Grouped with clear section description
- **Image gallery**: Horizontal scrolling with proper navigation hints
- **Input section**: Clear labels and state descriptions
- **Results area**: Live region for dynamic content updates

### Camera Screen
- **Permission handling**: Clear explanations and instructions
- **Camera preview**: Descriptive content for viewfinder
- **Capture button**: State-aware descriptions and haptic feedback
- **Status indicators**: Live announcements for camera state

### Report Dialog
- **Form structure**: Proper form semantics and navigation
- **Radio buttons**: Clear selection states and descriptions
- **Text input**: Optional field with helpful placeholder text
- **Action buttons**: Clear descriptions of submit and cancel actions

## Developer Guidelines

### Adding New UI Elements

1. **Always provide content descriptions**:
   ```kotlin
   modifier = Modifier.semantics {
       contentDescription = "Clear description of element purpose"
       role = Role.Button // or appropriate role
   }
   ```

2. **Use semantic roles**:
   ```kotlin
   // Use appropriate semantic roles
   role = Role.Button // or Role.Image, Role.TextInput, etc.
   ```

3. **Implement state descriptions**:
   ```kotlin
   modifier = Modifier.semantics {
       stateDescription = if (isSelected) "Selected" else "Not selected"
   }
   ```

4. **Add haptic feedback**:
   ```kotlin
   onClick = {
       AccessibilityHelper.provideHapticFeedback(context, HapticFeedbackType.CLICK)
       // Handle click
   }
   ```

### Testing New Features

1. **Enable TalkBack** and test all functionality
2. **Use AccessibilityTestHelper** to validate implementations
3. **Test with different font sizes** and display settings
4. **Verify touch target sizes** meet minimum requirements
5. **Check color contrast** ratios for new UI elements
