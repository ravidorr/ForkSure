## ðŸ“‹ Testing Tools & Frameworks

### Current Testing Stack
- **Unit Tests**: JUnit 4, Mockito, Robolectric
- **Integration Tests**: Espresso, Compose Testing
- **Test Doubles**: Custom Fake repositories
- **DI Testing**: Hilt Testing

### Recommended Additions
- **UI Testing**: Compose UI Testing framework
- **Performance**: Android Profiler integration
- **Accessibility**: Accessibility Testing Framework
- **Screenshot Testing**: Consider Paparazzi or similar

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Guidelines

### Test Organization
- Use `localThis` pattern for Jest-style tests (per user rules)
- Leverage existing `@folders` structure
- Separate unit tests (test/) from integration tests (androidTest/)

### Test Naming Conventions
```kotlin
// Unit tests
@Test
fun `should return valid recipe when input is correct`()

// Integration tests  
@Test
fun `should display error message when network fails`()
```

### Test Structure
```kotlin
// Given-When-Then pattern
@Test
fun `should update UI when data changes`() {
    // Given
    val initialState = MainScreenState()
    
    // When
    val result = updateState(initialState, newData)
    
    // Then
    assertEquals(expectedState, result)
}
```
