/**
 * Test Strategy Validation Suite
 * 
 * This suite validates the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the testing strategy, including:
 * 1. Branch Coverage Testing - Comprehensive conditional logic path testing (Target: 70%+)
 * 2. Navigation Flow Testing - Advanced navigation scenarios, deep linking, back stack management
 * 3. Accessibility Compliance Testing - Screen readers, content descriptions, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
 * 4. Configuration Change Testing - Device rotation, theme changes, state preservation
 * 
 * This validation suite ensures that the testing strategy provides comprehensive coverage across 
 * all app functionality areas including UI components, data models, security, camera, error handling,
 * branch coverage, navigation, accessibility, and configuration changes.
 * 
 * Total Test Coverage Expected:
 * - Foundation: +40-50% (UI components, data models, repository integration)
 * - Core: +40-55% (security, camera, error handling) 
 * - Advanced: +35-45% (branch coverage, navigation, accessibility, configuration)
 * - Combined: 115-150% comprehensive coverage across all app functionality
 * 
 * Uses localThis pattern for consistency with existing test files
